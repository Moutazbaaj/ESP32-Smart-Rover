## Architecture and Wiring

- All GNDs are tied together to form a shared common ground.
- Control logic (ESP32 + sensors + OLED) powered from regulated 5V line.
- Motors are isolated via TB6612FNG and powered from stepped-up 6V.

> Refer to the pin assignments within the code and ensure VIN/EN pins are properly handled (ESP32 EN tied to 10k pull-up if needed).

---



## Code Structure

### 1. `rover.ino`

- Sets up PWM for motor speed using `ledcSetup` and `ledcAttachPin`
- Receives ESP-NOW commands, parses instruction struct:
  ```cpp
  struct Command {
    int direction;
    int speed;
    bool toggleLight;
    bool autonomous;
  };
  ```
- Manages servo scanning using `SG90` on 9G Micro Servo
- Obstacle avoidance runs in main loop if `autonomousMode == true`
- LED ring controlled via `Adafruit_NeoPixel`

### 2. `controller.ino`

- Uses debounced 5-way tactile input
- Implements combo detection:
  - Simultaneous press of LEFT + RIGHT for 3s â†’ toggles autonomous mode
- Sends structured data packet over ESP-NOW
- Displays on OLED via `Adafruit_SSD1306`:
  - Action label
  - Distance (from rover feedback)
  - Servo angle
  - Speed

## Features

- **Manual Control**  
- **Autonomous Driving with Obstacle Avoidance**  
- **PWM-based Speed Adjustment**  
- **Servo-Based Ultrasonic Scanning**  
- **OLED Display for Real-time Feedback**  
- **RGB LED Ring Status Indicator**  
- **ESP-NOW Wireless Communication**  
- **Solar Backup Charging System**

## Power System

| Source         | Powers                  | Regulated by         |
|----------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| 4Ã— AA Lithium  | ESP32, sensors, OLED     | LM2596 to 5V          |
| 18650 Battery  | Motors                   | XL6009 to 6V          |
| Solar Panel    | Charges 18650            | BMS Module            |

> Fallback logic: if motor battery drops, the rover switches to main power.

---

## Operating Modes

### Manual Mode

- Direction and speed controlled by buttons
- Servo angle adjusted manually
- LED toggle + speed tuning supported

### Autonomous Mode

- Triggered by combo (LEFT + RIGHT)
- Activates continuous scanning and obstacle logic:
  ```cpp
  if (distance < threshold) {
    scanServo();
    decideNewDirection();
  }
  ```

## Controller Button Mapping

| Button | Function                      |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| UP     | Rotate Servo Left             |
| DOWN   | Rotate Servo Right            |
| FORWARD| Move Forward                  |
| BACK   | Move Backward                 |
| LEFT   | Turn Left                     |
| RIGHT  | Turn Right                    |
| CENTER | Center Servo to 90Â°           |
| LIGHT  | Toggle RGB LED Ring           |
| SPEED+ | Increase Motor Speed (PWM)    |
| SPEEDâ€“ | Decrease Motor Speed (PWM)    |
| LEFT+RIGHT | Hold 3s to toggle Autonomous Mode |

## Troubleshooting

- **No Movement** â†’ Check battery voltage and motor wiring.
- **No Response** â†’ Ensure ESP-NOW is initialized with matching MACs.
- **Sensor Issues** â†’ Recalibrate and check alignment/obstruction.

---

## Control Instructions

- Power ON both Rover and Controller
- Rover enters standby awaiting ESP-NOW input
- Use 5-way input to move, scan, and toggle features
- OLED will show real-time telemetry:
  - Distance in cm
  - Current mode
  - Speed (PWM level)
  - Servo angle
